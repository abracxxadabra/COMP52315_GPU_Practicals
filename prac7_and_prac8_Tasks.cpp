  // b) Write a SYCL programme that implements the element-wise addition of two vectors 
  //    by using the ND range version of the parallel_for kernel invocation API.
  // c) Execute both programmes once on a CPU, and once on a GPU, by constructing a SYCL queue 
  //    with the corresponding device selectors.
